This is a sample application which aims to help organizations craft CRA stewardship statements.

**IT IS NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO DONE**

The goal is to have a simple webpage to generate a `COMPLIANCE.md` file which contains useful information for CRA-compliant manufacturers about the development practices used by an open source project.

## Usage

`npm run dev` to try running it locally.

## Contributing

Hell yeah!  PRs please unless I've already talked to you.
